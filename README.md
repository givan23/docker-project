# docker-project
This project is a tutorial on how to implement docker, containers and CI/CD in github.

## GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.
- Create a new repository in GitHub
- Add a new file in the repository (example: Dockerfile) for the docker image
- Create workflow for CI (example: this will trigger the workflow when a push is made to the repository)
- Create workflow for CD (example: this will trigger the workflow when a pull request is made and approved to the repository)
- In the gitHub repository, go to Actions tab to see the workflows
- In the gitHub repository, go to Packages tab to see the docker image
- In the gitHub repository, go to Pull requests tab to see the pull requests
- In the gitHub repository, go to Settings tab to see the secrets

## Heroku
Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
- Install Heroku CLI
- Login to Heroku CLI
- Create a new app in Heroku
- Deploy the app to Heroku
- Access the app in Heroku
